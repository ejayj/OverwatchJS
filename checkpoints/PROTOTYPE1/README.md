# OverwatchJS

This prototype features full-demo functionality. when you submit a player, it will auto-fill with a list of dummy data. Hit create team or randomize to see the team make ups. 5v5 will have rejects, 6v6 will not (player pool sample size is 12). History will auto-config to your choice of team size. (could also do this for default?)

Contact and History pages are not finished and are only accessible through 5v5 index page.
Footer is not done, neither is header stylings.

Next things left to do:
-> finish contact/about(how to) page
-> begin stylings, or at the very least change header and footer banners
-> publish to github pages or on-render
-> add function to convert player ranks into numbers, and add up to median-team rank (e.g. diamond)
-> refine algorithm

======================================================
 Javascript implementation of the python overwatch team generator
 



The javascript notes folder holds the transcription of script.py into script.js; 
this has been transferred over to htdocs/OverwatchJS folder to get a simple version 
of this project off the ground and styled.

The intiial project is in OverwatchScript, which holds both python and javascript originals of this project.

Next Todo:
- Link javascript to HTML [display i/o]
- Fix final JS issues (blank role issue; call from html if someone has a blank role, then assign them one based on needs of the team)
- Js: create final team makeup (assigning who plays what based on their given roles: for actual game time)
- Stylings
- Publish on render or any other site that will host

deadline: Saturday

Next project:
- tonems dispatch website (php? how does php talk to json for save data)
- Overwatch script (python version)
- Switch spotify api to django, and script to flask?
-------------------------------------------------------
- Fix minute issues/bugs in code in this order:
- Overwatch JS, Discord bot, Overwatch Python, Ejay Codies, Python Spotify API
--------------------------------------------------------
- Create portfolio website
- Apply to places (should i have something speciifc in my github repo's for applications?)
========
- Then build a game!!!
