# OverwatchJS
 Javascript implementation of the overwatchs cript



The javascript notes folder holds the transcription of script.py into script.js; 
this has been transferred over to htdocs/OverwatchJS folder to get a simple version 
of this project off the ground and styled.

The intiial project is in OverwatchScript, which holds both python and javascript originals of this project.

Next Todo:
- Link javascript to HTML [display i/o]
- Fix final JS issues (blank role issue; call from html if someone has a blank role, then assign them one based on needs of the team)
- Js: create final team makeup (assigning who plays what based on their given roles: for actual game time)
- Stylings
- Publish on render or any other site that will host

deadline: Saturday
